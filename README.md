# Flow
*This repo is still very much a work in progress.*

The Flow language is a 3D visual dataflow language, which was originally written in Java as part of Newbound. Newbound supports Java, Python and Flow for server-side commands, and Javascript and Flow on the front-end. This repository contains a port of the flow language interpreter from the original Java, Python and Javascript versions included with Newbound.
